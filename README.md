# fairBench-tiny

This is a **high-performance C++ utility** for evaluating basic **fairness metrics** from large tabular datasets.  
It provides a lightweight command-line alternative to the [**FairBench**](https://github.com/mever-team/FairBench) Python framework â€” ideal for environments where Python is unavailable or where speed and memory efficiency are critical.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Fast parsing** of large CSV/TSV files with bare metal code.  
- **Group-wise metrics** for binary classification (tpr, tnr, accuracy, pr)
- **Aggregate fairness summaries**:
- **Color-coded output** for quick visual analysis.  
- **Minimal energy footprint** in a few kB of memory - set up as a worker.

## âš¡ Quickstart

Manual build: clone this repository and run `make`. This will
create the executable `build/fbt`. Use the *fbt* executable like so:

```bash
./fbt data.csv [--label colname] [--predict colname] [--threshold value] [--members min_count]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `data.csv` | Path to the CSV/TSV data file to analyze. |
| `--label <colname>` | Name of the column containing true labels (default: `label`). |
| `--predict <colname>` | Name of the column containing predicted labels (default: `predict`). |
| `--threshold <value>` | Highlight values below this fairness threshold in **red**, and above `1 - threshold` in **green** (default: `0.0`). |
| `--members <min_count>` | Minimum number of samples required for a group to be included in the report. Groups with fewer members are ignored. |


## ðŸ“˜ Expected Input

The first line must contain column headers (group names, *label*, and *predict*). Columns may be separated by **comma `,`**, **tab `\t`**, or **semicolon `;`** â€” the first delimiter encountered is used. **Whitespace** is ignored everywhere.  

All rows must have the same number of columns as the header, and must contain **binary (0/1)** values for every column. 
Here is an example:

```csv
gender,region,label,predict
1,0,1,1
0,0,0,0
1,1,1,0
0,1,0,1
```
